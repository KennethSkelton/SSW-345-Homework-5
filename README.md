# Reflection

Over the past few milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a project.

### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?
    The most helpful part of thinking about the design of our project was how we were able to predict issues that we might run into if we had decided to design it in a different way other than the one we chose, and effectively stop those potential issues before we ran into them.  

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
    The thing that was most difficult was definitely figuring out how we should best handle persistance with our bot, I we could do it over I would definitely start solving this problem way earlier in development.  

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
    I would try the user story design method again in a future project, it really allowed me to focus on the most important issues first, and understand the scope of the project all at once.  

### Testing

1. What was most helpful about implementing integration tests and mocking in your project?
    Being able to catch small implemtation errors quickly before they became large problems was the most helpful part of using integration testing.  

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
    The most difficult thing about testing was leaning how to use the testing programs themselves, I had no previous experiance with real testing before, (writing test cases or using them), so this was new to me.  

3. What testing methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
    I would definitely use Travis CI again it was really easy to use and really helpful for testing.  

### Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing scrum-ban in your project?
    The most helpful thing about implementing scrum-ban in our project was how I was able to clearly see my assignments and understand how the work I was doing would fit into the completed project as a whole.  

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
    The most difficult thing about scrum-ban was how I had to be consistent with my scheduling rather than more freeform, if I was extra busy one week I was still expected to have my sprint's work done even if it wasn't.  

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
    I would definitly want to continue using the agile structure again, just to get used to it, and maybe to train myself to become more regular and consistent.  

### Overall

Considering all the design and architecture methods, testing practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and constrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

   Iterative testing works great with the scrum-ban method of software development because the test structure mirrors how the project is being built, iteratively. Allowing people to create and test small parts of the project to ensure that they work before bringing them together is a massive bonus. Then these small parts are mapped together into larger user stories to ensure that the work that is done is focused and clear. These practices, that we used in our project work great for that reason
